<h2>VERSION 13.01</h2>

<h2>Building and Configuration</h2>
You can use maven to build this project and create eclipse projects.  A full verison of 
rxtx is not available in the on line maven repo you will have to manually install it in your local
m2_repo.  maven will use the copy in your local repo after whining a little about not finding it 
on the Internet.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Download the rxtx zip file and unpack it.</li>  
    <li>Create his directory your local m2_repo 
        <br>$M2_REPO\org\rxtx\RXTXcomm\2.2pre2</li>
    <li>Copy the two dll files and the jar using the following naming convention style
        <ul>
        <li>rxtxcomm.jar     --> RXTXcomm-2.2pre2.jar</li>
        <li>rxtxSerial.dll   --> RXTXcomm-2.2pre2-rxtxSerial.dll</li>
        <li>// this jar missing 2.2pre2 rxtxParallel.dll --> RXTXcomm-2.2pre2-rxtxParallel.dll</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Copy the sample rxtx pom file src/test/resources/RXTXcomm-2.2pre2.pom to $M2_REPO\org\rxtx\RXTXcomm\2.2pre2 to simplify usage </li>
</ul>  
<b>linux</b>  I haven't tried this on LINUX but it should work with the appropriate libraries.
You will probably have to change the entry in the pom so that the so file will get installed
instead of the .dll file.
<p></p>
Then compile the project and build the eclipse project configuration. We skip tests here because 
they expect all supported hardware to be in hardcoded places. You will probably just run a couple 
of them that are tied to your hardware
<ol>
<li>run <kbd>mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install</kbd></li>
<li>run <kbd>mvn eclipse:eclipse</kbd> and then refresh your project</li>
<li>Open Ecipse and turn OFF continuous testing if you have Infinitest installed. It doesn't know the native library load path and will fail in ways that will confuse you for days.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Execution and configuration</h2>
The dll location needs to be added to the library load path if you wish to run programs
from within Eclipse then you need to run them with additional configuration.

<h3>eclipse</h3>
<pre>
    Set java.library.path=<path to project>/lib for each program or test you run in eclipse. Open
        Run Configurations-->Arguments-->VMArgs  
    and add the following with the appropriate path for your environment
            -Djava.library.path=<path_to_project>/target/lib

    The main program (BuildMonitorDriver) reads its paramteres from a properties file, default.properties by default.
    The location of the properties file can be overriden by passing the name of the new properties file as a command line parameter.
    <p>
    Example parameters are in src/main/resources/default.properties and in src/test/resources/test.properties.
    The parameters are documented in the source file.  You can set the parameters.  Open
        Run Configurations-->Arguments-->Program Arguments
    and add the properties file name as a parameter.  These settings run two lights based on Hudson builds on the Internet
    with an attached light set on the specified COM port in my environment.
        <pre>
        device.serial.port=COM3
        device.serial.speed=9600
        device.class.name=com.freemansoft.watcher.devices.ArduinoDualRGB
        buildserver.uri=https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/cc.xml
        buildserver.projects=lugins_virtualbox,plugins_checkstyle
        </pre>    
    or
        <pre>
        device.serial.port=COM3
        device.serial.speed=112500
        device.class.name=com.freemansoft.watcher.devices.LEDCube
        buildserver.uri=https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/cc.xml
        buildserver.projects=junit-runtime-suite
        </pre>    
</pre>

<h3>maven</h3>
The pom.xml contains an <code>exec:exec</code> target that will run the program.  Edit the pom.xml
so that it points at your port, speed, device type , server and builds.  Then run the program with 
<kbd>mvn exec:exec</kbd>

<h3>Standalone</h3>    
When running stand alone programs, outside of Eclipse, you must do additional configuration
<ul>
    <li>Set java.library.path=<path to project>/target/lib to pick up the dll files</li>
    <li>Add <path to project>/target/lib to the classpath to pick up the rxtxcomm.jar jar file</li>
</ul>

<b>It is not necesary to copy the rxtx code into your installed JRE if you set the classpath and 
java.library.path correctly</b>    
    
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

Yellow lights mean the program is confused either because there is no build server at the
requested address or because one of the build names does not exists. Multiple-light systems
provide a little more hints on what the problem might be.
<ul>
    <li>All build lights yellow means either there is no server at the requested address or 
        that the program could not parse the returned XML</li>
    <li>One light yellow probably means that build no longer exists</li>
    <li>Errors will be logged via log4j for any yellow lights</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
You could also have port and data rate mis-configuration. The system will fail with an obvious
message if it cannot open the port.  It will hang if you connect to a real (but wrong) COM port.  
It will also hang if you use the wrong data rate.   
<p></p>
Program threads may keep running after you've hit ctrl'c when running from <kbd>mvn exec:exec</kbd>.
The command kills the maven process but not the actual Build Light program.
You may have to use your process/task manager to kill the actual java program.
<p></p>
You can increase or decrease the amount of logging by changing the logging level
in <code>src/main/resources/log4j.xml</code> Setting the default logging level to <code>INFO</code> will be pretty much silent while
<code>DEBUG</code> will be very noisy.

<h2>Supported Devices</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>SeeedStudio LED Cube</b>The cube is based on the Seeed Studio Rainbowduino.  You will need
to update the firmware to run it as a build light.  This program currently expects to use
version 1.0.7 available on my blog. It would be possible to create a new driver based on the
original firmware.  The mapping from 2D frame buffer to 3D LED cube would have to then be
done on the java side. The driver resets this device using DTR and then waits for it's initialization string. 
You may see the lights blink after the reset.</li>
<li><b>Dual Arduino</b>This is a simple Arduino board with two RGB LED lights. I built mine using
the bright Sparkfun LED breakout boards.  This software expects to use firmware available on my blog
because it knows how to send that firmware's command stream. 
The driver resets this device using DTR and then waits for it's initialization string. 
You may see the lights blink after the reset.</li>
<li><b>Quad(Quint) Arduino</b>This is an Arduino system that uses an I2C expander chip to add additional PWM ports.  I used the Jee Labs Dimmer plug and the Sparkfun LED breakout boards.  This software expects to use firmware availabe on my blog because it understands that command structure.</li>
</ul>
